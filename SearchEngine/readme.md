Work Procedures:
1) Assignments are added to the github issue tracker.

3) I will review the code as needed and add comments to the issue tracker assignement for corrections/suggestions.
4) When coding is done we will collaboratively merge the code into the Test branch.
5) After the code is merged, we will checkout the Tets branch and test the application.
6) If there are any issues we will correct them in the Test branch, retest and push the working Test branch back to the repo.
7) Finally we will merge the Test branch into the Master branch then add the Proj-3 tag.
